# About

Here is my trial-and-error playground. I'm a MSc student in Data Science with a passion for sports and history.
- This will be a compilation of notebooks I created for data analysis and exploration, mostly for personal interests.
- Currently learning deep learning and working on Formula 1 pit-stop strategies
      
## Projects/Notebooks/Data Work:

### 1. Premier League Teams' Transfer Details
Webscraped from TransferMarkt, this dataset includes the categories: 'player, age, nationality, position, market value, former team, current team, season, and fee'.
* It can be adjusted for any year.

### 2. "Classifying a child's handwriting to determine the presence of a writing disorder (dysgraphia)."
A time series competition in which I achieved the highest accuracy score with Arsenal time series classifier. This competition was part of the Spatiotemporal Data Analysis course at Tilburg University, offered by dr. Sharon Ong.
