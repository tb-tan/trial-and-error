## About

**Project**: Premier League Teams' Transfer Details

This script is a web scraping that collects data about transfers of each EPL team from [TransferMarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/), created by using BeautifulSoup in Python.
- It features categories: 'player, age, nationality, position, market value (€), former team, current team, season, transfer fee (€), end of loan date'.
- Available in .csv format for the years 2020-2024. However, it is adjustable for any year/season.
- Also on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tugbatandogan/epl-summer-transfers-2000-2024-from-transfermarkt/data) from 2000 to 2004.
- Possible updates/improvement:
  - Separating names and surnames
  - Converting the market value and fee columns to numerical format and fixing ordinal relationships (k to m)
  - Editing rows like "Loan fee:2.00m"
  - Fixing missing second nationalities of players
  - Adding transfer info of players who left
 
PS: First web scraping attempt
